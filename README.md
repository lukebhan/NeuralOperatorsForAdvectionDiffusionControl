# Neural Operators for Advection Diffusion PDE Control

The source code for the paper titled Neural Operators of Backstepping Controller and Observer
Gain Functions for Reaction-Diffusion PDEs: [arxiv](http://128.84.21.203/abs/2303.10506)

## Sysetm Requirements
All of the code is written in Python 3 and relies on standard packages such as numpy, Pytorch, Scipy, and the 
deep learning package [DeepXDE](https://github.com/lululxvi/deepxde). Additionally, all code
in this work is nicely formatted in a jupyter-notebook. A basic installation
will require the installation of Python, jupyter along with DeepXDE and PyTorch. Please see the 
import statements in the Jupyter-notebooks to make sure all files are included. 

## Demos

### Dataset and Models
All precomputed datasets and models are available here [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EYg1eequk02SnkhTmBAk6_yFO158f9d6?usp=sharing)

All code is available in Jupyter-notebook and should be very straightforward to run. Datasets do not take long to generate and the model may take about a half hour to 45 minutes.
